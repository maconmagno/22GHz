# 22GHz Data Release 
**22 GHz Radio Data of The BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey ([BASS](https://www.bass-survey.com/)). The native resolution of our observations is 1". We also produce UV-tapered images with 3" and 6" resolution.**

If any images are missing or if you would like a different lower resolution image feel free to email me at [mmagno@smu.edu] or post in the [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/maconmagno/22GHz/discussions) for this data release. 

I would also be happy to answer any questions about the images through email or through the Discussions on GitHub.
